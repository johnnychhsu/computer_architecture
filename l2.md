## Cache review
### Register file
- Array (Square)
- Raw decoder, column decoder

### SRAM
- Memory array
- Many transiters for a cell in the memory square

### DRAM
- Memory array
- Structure is different from SRAM
- Take the smallest area to store a bit
- One transistor and on capacitor
- Trade off between capacity, latency, bandwith, etc.
