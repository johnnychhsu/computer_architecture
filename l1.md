## Computer Architecture Intro
### Architecture and Microarchitecture
1. Architecture : Instruction set, how programmer see the computer
2. Microarchitecture : Hardware implementation. Trade off between many different factors, such as power, pipeline depth, etc.

### Machine model
1. Stack based 
    - Real stack is bounded, but conceptually unbounded
2. Register
3. Register Memory
4. Register Register

### Addressing mode (How to get operands from memory?)
Depends on ISA design and hardware implementation.

### ISA encoding
1. Fixed length for each instruction v.s variable length.

### Why diversity in ISAs?
1. Technology influences
    - Memory is expensive
    - Reduced instruction due to the capacity of chips
2. Application influences
    - Compilers' abilities

## Pipeline review
### Microcoded microcontroller
1. Instruction encoded, the controller(ROM) has the fixed instructions that can read in the program.

### Pipeline in processor
Pipeline can reduce CPI and has shorter cycle time.
#### Ideal pipeline
1. All objects go through the same stages
2. No sharing or resources between different stages
3. Scheduling of a transaction entering the pipeline is not affected by any other transactionsin other stages

However, instructions depend on other instructions causes different hazards.

#### Unpipeline datapath
1. Long cycle
    - program counter -> instruction memory -> register file -> memory fetching (option) -> write back to register file -> update program counter

#### Pipeline the data
1. Use register pipelines to store the result for each stages.

#### Pipeline control
1. Hardwired controller, registers to store the instructions.

#### Processor performance
1. Time / Program = Instructions / Program * Cycle / Instruction * Time / Cycle
2. The time for each stage (instructions fetch, register file, execution, write back) depends on some technology assumptions.

#### Hazard
1. Structure hazard
    - Different instructions use the same resource.
    - Programmer can avoid such situation.
    - We can stall the instruction for a cycle. For example, two load instruction overlap on the memory stage.
2. Data hazard
    - Instructions depend on the previous results of other instructions still in the pipeline.
    - We can stall also (interlock), add stall condition for controller, add no operation multiplex for instruction register in the pipeline. We need compare multiplexer for read source and write destination comparison. Also need write enable bit for performance issue (not every time the register_source and register_destination match that we should stall).
    - Or bypass (hardware datapath that allow to send data to later instruction), speculate (kill and restart).

3. Control hazard
